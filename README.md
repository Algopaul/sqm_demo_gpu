# Streaming quadratic manifolds
## Euler simulation demo

Computes simulations of the Kelvin Helmholtz instability and stores an evolving singular value decomposition of the snapshot data. The main simulation routine which includes updating the singular value decomposition is run in `sqm_demo/tracked_euler.py`
